# Internet-Mobile-Applications-Project
This is my App for Internet and Mobile applications, iv'e decided to build/make a calculator.

My reason for making this application is simply because ive always wanted to make a calculator, find out how it functions and to improve my C# skills for future reference. It may be very basic but its the one thing ive never made/created but wanted to so that was a major reason why i chose to do this. You can argue that today all smart phones have a calculator already installed, i did this to see how the application works and maybe even rival the already default calculator. Hope you enjoy this application. 

Thank you all, 
Regards Andreas Fahey
